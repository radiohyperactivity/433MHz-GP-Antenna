Continuing my journey into LoRa APRS it was about time for my iGate / Digipeater to get it's own antenna. So far it's been connected to the X50 I normally use for 2m/70cm FM. After evaluating many potential designs, from a regular vertical dipole to a j-pole, I settled on the venerable ¼λ (quarter wavelength) ground plane antenna. For my use case, this has the perfect combination of a high gain and a high enough WAF (wife acceptance factor). The traditional design usually calls for 4 radials, pointing downward at a 45° (more strictly 42°) angle for the best match to a 50Ω coaxial cable. The dimensions given during the build turned out to be to long, and I ended up cutting 27mm of the radials and 5mm of the vertical element. Thus the finished project, that showed an SWR of less then 1:1.2 at 433.775MHz, was as follows:

**Radiator:** 159mm

**Radials:** 157mm

The design uses 5 different 3D-printed parts. All of these are fully parametric. If you want to used different dimensions, just update the spreadsheet in the FreeCAD design file:
